# Auto-MPG-Notebook
I have completed the Auto MPG EDA and Regression Advanced Techniques dataset from Kaggle, utilizing data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Additionally, I have built the model using Linear Regression and advanced techniques to enhance its accuracy.

# Before proceeding with my notebook, I approached it in two ways:Â¶
* I first focused on data visualization, as the dataset is intended for this purpose.
* Additionally, I utilized advanced techniques in linear regression to build and apply my model.
* Please ensure to implement these approaches sequentially and judiciously, avoiding simultaneous use to prevent unnecessary complexity.

# Conclusion

The Auto MPG dataset provides valuable insights into the fuel efficiency of cars from various model years, ranging from 1970 to 1982. Key variables such as mpg (miles per gallon), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin help in understanding the factors influencing a car's fuel efficiency.
